                        <h4><span>What's a responsive website, and why should I have one?</span></h4>
                        <p>A responsive site is one that adapts to whatever device is being used. It changes appearence
                            depending on screen size and orientation. As of 2022, over 60% of internet traffic comes
                            from mobile devices and that number will only increase. If your website is not
                            mobile-friendly (in other words, it doesn't look just as good, and respond just as well, on
                            different mobile devices as it does on a
                            laptop) then most users won't stick around for any longer than a few seconds. Also, Google's
                            algorithms will punish non responsive sites, meaning you or your company will not rank
                            highly on a Google search.</p>

                        <h4><span>I haven't been losing any clients/fans, so why should I worry about optimising my
                                website?</span></h4>
                        <p>First of all, if not losing clients is your metric, it's a pretty shitty business plan. As an
                            artist or a small business, you should obviously be always trying to attract new fans and
                            clients, preferably without losing existing ones. If your website is old, poorly designed,
                            or non responsive (see above) then keeping those potential customers for more than 30
                            seconds is going
                            to be hard. Optimising your website can help attract new clients, keep them engaged and
                            eventually convert them into paying customers.</p>

                        <h4><span>My Facebook Page is my 'website', and I use Instagram for publicity. Why should I
                                bother with anything else?</span></h4>
                        <p>Well, a Facebook page is NOT a website and while Instagram is great for publicising products
                            and creating
                            content that shares your know-how with the world, here's some data to think about.
                            Only 55% of the world’s population is on social media. The US and the UK both have just over
                            65% active social media users. Facebook has a user base of just under 3 billion, and there
                            are close to 1.5 billion active Instagram users. Those are impressive numbers, and obviously
                            the reach of social media is huge especially for small businesses, but let’s flip those
                            numbers.
                            Somewhere close to 30% of the US and UK populations don’t use social media. Almost 1 billion
                            people don’t use Facebook and 42% of internet users don’t use Instagram. Therefore, if you
                            only use these two platforms to reach fans and clients, you are missing out on a massive
                            number of potential customers. So it’s really a no-brainer to have a website. It’s somewhere
                            that clients and potential clients who don't use social media can always find information
                            about your services, merchandise or gigs, irrespective of the latest social media trends. A
                            website is also the best place to build your email list.
